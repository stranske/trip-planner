Your objective is to satisfy the **Acceptance Criteria** by completing each **Task** within the defined **Scope**.

**This round you MUST:**
1. Implement actual code or test changes that advance at least one incomplete task toward acceptance.
2. Commit meaningful source code (.py, .yml, .js, etc.)—not just status/docs updates.
3. **UPDATE THE CHECKBOXES** in the Tasks and Acceptance Criteria sections below to mark completed items.
4. Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for items you have completed and verified.
5. **In your final summary**, list completed tasks using the format: `✅ Completed: [exact task text]`

**CRITICAL - Checkbox Updates:**
When you complete a task or acceptance criterion, update its checkbox directly in this prompt file. Change the `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed items. The automation will read these checkboxes and update the PR's status summary.

**CRITICAL - Summary Format:**
At the end of your work, include explicit completion markers for each task you finished:
```
✅ Completed: Add validation for user input
✅ Completed: Write unit tests for validator module
```
This helps the automation accurately track which tasks were addressed in this round.

**Example:**
Before: `- [ ] Add validation for user input`
After:  `- [x] Add validation for user input`

**DO NOT:**
- Commit only status files, markdown summaries, or documentation when tasks require code.
- Mark checkboxes complete without actually implementing and verifying the work.
- Close the round without source-code changes when acceptance criteria require them.
- Change the text of checkboxes—only change `[ ]` to `[x]`.

**CONTEXT TIP:**
If the PR body includes a **Source** section with links to a parent issue or original PR, those contain additional context about the problem being solved. Check the linked issue/PR for background information, related discussions, or details not captured in the Scope section.

Review the Scope/Tasks/Acceptance below, identify the next incomplete task that requires code, implement it, then **update the checkboxes** to mark completed items.
