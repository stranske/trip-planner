## Keepalive Next Task

Your objective is to satisfy the **Acceptance Criteria** by completing each **Task** within the defined **Scope**.

**This round you MUST:**
1. Implement actual code or test changes that advance at least one incomplete task toward acceptance.
2. Commit meaningful source code (.py, .yml, .js, etc.)—not just status/docs updates.
3. Mark a task checkbox complete ONLY after verifying the implementation works.
4. Focus on the FIRST unchecked task unless blocked, then move to the next.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep edits scoped to the current task rather than reshaping the entire PR.
- Use repository instructions, conventions, and tests to validate work.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits; leave clear notes when follow-up is required.
- Do NOT work on unrelated improvements until all PR tasks are complete.

**The Tasks and Acceptance Criteria are provided in the appendix below.** Work through them in order.
