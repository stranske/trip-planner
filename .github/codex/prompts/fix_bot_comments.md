# Fix Bot Review Comments

Review bots have left suggestions on this PR. Your task is to address each one.

## Instructions

1. **Read each bot comment** in the sections below
2. **Implement suggested fixes** that improve code quality, correctness, or maintainability
3. **Skip suggestions** that are incorrect, don't apply, or would make the code worse
4. **Document your decisions** in your commit message

## Guidelines

### When to FIX a suggestion:
- It corrects a genuine bug or issue
- It improves type safety or error handling
- It follows established project patterns
- It improves readability or maintainability

### When to SKIP a suggestion:
- It contradicts project conventions
- It's based on incomplete context
- The suggested change would break functionality
- It's purely stylistic with no clear benefit

2. **Include** in your commit message which suggestions you addressed and skipped:
   ```
