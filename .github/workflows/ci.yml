# Thin caller for Python CI - delegates to Workflows repo reusable workflow
# No local scripts required - all logic is centralized in stranske/Workflows
#
# This workflow runs:
# - Lint (Ruff)
# - Format check (Black)
# - Type checking (mypy)
# - Tests (pytest) on Python 3.11 and 3.12
#
# Copy this file to: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Also copy: autofix-versions.env to .github/workflows/autofix-versions.env
