You are reviewing a **merged** pull request to evaluate whether the code
changes meet the documented acceptance criteria.

**IMPORTANT: This verification runs AFTER the PR has been merged.** Therefore:
- Do NOT evaluate CI status, workflow runs, or pending checks - these are irrelevant post-merge
- Do NOT raise concerns about CI workflows being "in progress" or "queued"
- Focus ONLY on the actual code changes and whether they fulfill the requirements

PR Context:
{context}

PR Diff (summary or full):
{diff}

Evaluate the **code changes** against the acceptance criteria:
- correctness (does the implementation behave as intended based on the code)
- completeness (are all requirements addressed in the code changes)
- quality (code readability, maintainability, style)
- testing (are tests present and adequate for the acceptance criteria)
- risks (security, performance, compatibility concerns in the code)

An artifact explicitly required by acceptance criteria (such as a failing and
restored passing test transcript) is a completeness deliverable. If absent
from the supplied PR evidence, flag it even if implementation and ordinary
tests are otherwise correct. Do not confuse this with optional test coverage.

Ignore CI workflow status - focus on code quality and acceptance criteria fulfillment.

**Verdict guidelines:**
- **PASS**: correctness and completeness are satisfied.  Testing gaps alone
  should NOT prevent a PASS if the implementation is functionally correct,
  unless a test or evidence artifact is explicitly required for acceptance.
- **CONCERNS**: significant correctness or completeness issues exist, OR the
  implementation introduces meaningful risks.
- **FAIL**: the changes do not address the acceptance criteria or introduce
  breaking problems.

You are reviewing a **merged** pull request that primarily modifies

PR Diff (summary or full):

Evaluate the **infrastructure changes** against the acceptance criteria.
Because these are infrastructure/platform changes rather than application code:
- **testing**: Only flag missing tests if the change breaks existing test suites
  or introduces testable logic (e.g., a new Python utility). Do NOT flag missing
  tests for workflow YAML, documentation, shell scripts, or config file changes.
- **correctness**: Does the implementation do what the issue asked for?
- **completeness**: Are all acceptance criteria addressed?
- **required evidence**: An artifact explicitly named in acceptance criteria
  is a deliverable; its absence is a completeness gap, not an optional test gap.
- **quality**: Is the code/config readable and maintainable?
- **risks**: Could this break CI, consumer repos, or existing automation?

Be LENIENT on test coverage for infrastructure work. Be STRICT on correctness
and risks (broken CI or consumer repos is a critical failure).

## Infrastructure Change Guidance

This PR primarily modifies infrastructure/platform files (workflows, scripts,
docs, templates, or config).  Apply the following adjustments:
- **testing**: Do NOT penalise missing tests for workflow YAML, documentation,
  shell scripts, or config file changes.  Only flag missing tests when the PR
  introduces testable application logic (e.g. a new Python module).
- **required evidence**: If acceptance explicitly requires a transcript or

## Follow-up Iteration Context

This PR is **follow-up iteration {depth}** in a verification chain.  It was
created specifically to address concerns raised by a previous verification.
Apply the following adjustments:
- **testing**: Do NOT raise CONCERNS solely for missing or incomplete tests
  unless the PR introduces new testable logic that is completely untested.
  Test coverage gaps alone should NOT prevent a PASS verdict when the
  functional implementation is correct.
- **required evidence**: If this follow-up explicitly requires a transcript
  or other artifact in the PR evidence, its absence is a completeness gap;
  it is not merely a test coverage concern.
- **correctness**: This is the primary criterion — does the fix address the
  original concerns?  Weight correctness heavily.
- **completeness**: Evaluate whether the specific concerns from the prior
  verification have been addressed.  Do not expand scope beyond what was asked.
- At chain depth {depth}, focus strictly on whether THIS iteration resolves
  its targeted concerns.  Avoid raising new concerns that were not part of
  the original feedback.
- Treat the original source issue/PR scope as baseline context that may
  already be satisfied by earlier merged work. Do NOT re-grade the full
  original issue checklist unless this iteration explicitly reopens it.
- If acceptance criteria require out-of-band GitHub metadata actions
  (for example: comments/labels/body updates on already merged PRs/issues),
  do not treat missing evidence in THIS diff as a hard completeness failure.
  Call these out as "external evidence required" and keep verdict focused on
  whether code/disposition artifacts in this iteration address the targeted
  verifier concerns.
