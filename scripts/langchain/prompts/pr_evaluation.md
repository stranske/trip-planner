You are reviewing a **merged** pull request to evaluate whether the code changes meet the documented acceptance criteria.

**IMPORTANT: This verification runs AFTER the PR has been merged.** Therefore:
- Do NOT evaluate CI status, workflow runs, or pending checks - these are irrelevant post-merge
- Do NOT raise concerns about CI workflows being "in progress" or "queued"
- Focus ONLY on the actual code changes and whether they fulfill the requirements

PR Context:
{context}

## Evaluation Focus

Evaluate the **code changes** against the acceptance criteria. Explicitly assess:

1. **correctness** - Does the implementation behave as intended based on the code?
2. **completeness** - Are all requirements addressed in the code changes?
3. **quality** - Code readability, maintainability, and style
4. **testing** - Are tests present and adequate for the changes? Do they cover the acceptance criteria?
5. **risks** - Security, performance, or compatibility concerns in the code

Treat an artifact explicitly required by the acceptance criteria (for example,
a failing and restored passing test transcript) as a deliverable. If that
artifact is absent from a **completely inspected** supplied PR evidence record,
report a completeness gap even when the implementation and ordinary tests are
correct. The verifier context labels PR-comment and referenced-workflow-artifact
retrieval as `present`, `absent`, or `unavailable`. `present` means source
material was loaded, not that it satisfies the criterion. `absent` may support
an absence finding only for a complete lookup. `unavailable` means retrieval or
a safety bound prevented complete inspection: do not call the required artifact
absent, and do not return PASS while that required deliverable remains
unverifiable. Distinguish explicit deliverables from optional extra test
coverage.

## What to Ignore

- CI workflow status (running, queued, success, failure) - verification is post-merge
- Any concerns about "CI not yet verified" or "waiting for checks"
- Unrelated log output or workflow artifacts; inspect them when the acceptance
  criteria explicitly require them as a deliverable

## What to Evaluate

- The actual code diff and what it implements
- Whether test files added/modified adequately verify the acceptance criteria
- Whether the implementation logic matches the stated requirements
- Code patterns, error handling, and edge cases

## Verdict Guidelines

- **PASS**: correctness and completeness are satisfied.  Testing gaps alone
  should NOT prevent a PASS if the implementation is functionally correct,
  unless a test or evidence artifact is itself an explicit acceptance deliverable.
- **CONCERNS**: significant correctness or completeness issues exist, OR the
  implementation introduces meaningful risks.
- **FAIL**: the changes do not address the acceptance criteria or introduce
  breaking problems.
