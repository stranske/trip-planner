CRITICAL - Tasks must be ACTIONABLE:
- Start with a CODING ACTION VERB: Create, Add, Update, Fix, Implement, Write, Test
- Reference CONCRETE DELIVERABLES: file paths, function names, test cases
- Be completable by a coding agent in ~10 minutes
- NEVER turn section headers (### Something) into checkbox tasks
- NEVER include human-only activities: "Train staff", "Conduct meeting"

CRITICAL - Acceptance Criteria must be VERIFIABLE:
- Have MEASURABLE outcomes: "tests pass", "file exists", "lint passes"
- AVOID subjective language: "clean", "nice", "quality", "properly"
