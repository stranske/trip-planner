# Codex working files (preserved via workflow artifacts, not git)
# These files are rebuilt each run and would cause merge conflicts
# if multiple PRs commit them. Historical data is preserved in:
# - PR comments (completion summaries)
# - Workflow artifacts (full outputs)
# - Commit messages (change descriptions)
